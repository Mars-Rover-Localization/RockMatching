# Rock & Crater Detection and Pattern Matching
This project mainly aims to solve the image matching problem in low-texture environment such as Mars or Moon surface.

Currently, the following main features are implemented:
* Rock & Crater detection from surface point cloud
* Rock & Crater detection using YOLOv5 framework
* Pattern matching using ICP algorithm
* DEM generation from point cloud data

The robustness of this method is still undergoing tests, will be merged with main project [A2G-Localization](https://github.com/Mars-Rover-Localization/A2G-Localization) in the future.
