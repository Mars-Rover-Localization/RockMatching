# RockMatching
This project mainly aims to solve the image matching problem in low-texture environment such as Mars or Moon surface.

Currently, the following main features are implemented:
* Rock & Crater detection from surface point cloud
* Crater detection using YOLOv5 framework
* Pattern matching using ICP algorithm
* DEM generation from point cloud data
